I am pursuing my BS in Graphic Information Techology with a focus on digital design. After graduation, I hope to find a job in the creative design field where I can use my creative skills expressively and with a company that aligns with my values.

I am still relatively new to the world of web development and coding, so my technical skills are pretty minimal. However, what I do love about coding is how complex yet simple it truly is. At first glance, I was very overwhelmed by my first coding assignment. After some practice, I quickly got the hang of it and I actually enjoyed coding - which I did not expect as I prefer creative design.
